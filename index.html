                <h1>Akiyo Fuuka</h1>
<p>A 2nd year student and one of the members of the School Lunch Club which manages the cafeteria at Gehenna Academy. Working hard every morning to make a huge number of meals for everyone in the school, her kindness and diligence make her a rarity amongst Gehenna students.
    While her meals are certainly good, but due to the cafeteria being understaffed, her true culinary skills tend to go undervalued. Nevertheless, she does not intend to give up and puts in effort day-by-day to make the better menu.</p>

                <h1>Sunaookami Shiroko</h1>
<p>Shiroko is a soft-spoken girl, who deeply cares for her friends, to the extent that she would do anything to help her friends towards their goal of revitalizing the school. Though she is generally calm and reserved, she hyperfocuses on certain interests and can sometimes be oblivious to how others would react to them. She often bikes and walks far more than regular people can keep up, thinking distances of 10s of kilometers are average for her. She fantasizes about robbing banks and going on survival fishing trips, and being unable to do either of these things causes her to pout and act with remarkable petulance for how calm she usually is. Shiroko is willing to fight Hina the moment she laid eyes on her despite the head prefect's reputation, stopping only at Ayane's begging. She requires people like Sensei and Ayane to hold her back and keep her sensible.</p>

                <h1>Shirasu Azusa</h1>
<p>A cold person at the core, much of Azusa's aloof nature stems from her training under Arius and being raised as a weapon. Because of her dedication to the mission, she has no hobbies or any interests and does not make any attempts to befriend her classmates in the Supplementary Lessons Department. The training made her extremely adept at combat, having extensive knowledge on how to kill the other students by destroying their halos and lives a spartan lifestyle, focusing on her missions and studies ahead.
    Through her experiences in the Supplementary Lessons Department, she learns to enjoy life and find purpose in her actions and develops a friendship with Hifumi and Sensei as a result. However, she still has an emotional conflict between her loyalty towards Arius Squad and the necessity of murdering them to prevent Trinity and to a lesser extent Kivotos from falling into ruin.</p>

                <h1>Tendou Alice</h1>
<p>At first, Alice's personality seemed robotic in both speaking and answering. However, as the story progresses, she starts acting livelier although her speech and mannerisms are nearly close to someone with the "chuunibyou" syndrome, a result from being exposed to playing video games.
    Key however, is a stone-cold AI who wanted Alice to slaughter everything but later abandons that goal and starts trying to protect her "Princess" at all costs.</p>

<p>Noa is the secretary of the student council "Seminar" at Millennium Science School. She has a very good memory and can memorize almost everything she sees or hears once, including decisions made at the "Seminar" and records of the contents of meetings.
    Noa's uniform consists of white and blue low heel boots, black tights, a pleated white skirt and blazer with a tech adorned jacket hung over her arms. Underneath the blazer is a white dress-shirt and blue tie with her Millennium access card clipped onto the blazer's side pocket.</p>
